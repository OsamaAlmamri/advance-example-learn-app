To  Run Job

php artisan queue:work

php artisan queue:work --queue=payments,default
php artisan queue:work --queue=default,payments

------------------------------

To retry  Run Job
php artisan queue:retry 10
-------- 10 is a id of failed_jobs table

To  Run Job with tries 3 times
php artisan queue:work --tries=3   or set in job class {  public $tries = 3;}
This worker is going to attempt a job 3 times before it considers it a failure.


---------------------------
If a job fails to complete and multiple tries were configured, the worker will
dispatch the job back to the queue. That newly dispatched job will be picked
up again by a worker.
   public $backoff = 60;//seconds

   So if the job fails to complete at 22:09:00, the workers will only try it at
   22:10:00 or after.
----------------------
If a job fails for a second time, 60 seconds might not be not enough time for
the mailing service to recover. It might be a good idea to increase the delay
after each attempt:

in code
 public $backoff = [60, 120];
in console
php artisan queue:work --backoff=60,120
